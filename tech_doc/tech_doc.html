                <p>HTML is a fundamental language used to create and structure web pages. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It uses a series of tags to define and format the content within a web page.</p>
                <p>It's important to note that HTML is constantly evolving, and there are more advanced concepts and features beyond this brief introduction. However, this overview should give you a starting point to understand the basic purpose and structure of HTML.</p>

                <header>Key HTML Points </header>
                <p>Here are a few key points to understand about HTML:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Structure: HTML provides the structure and layout of a web page. It uses a hierarchical structure known as the Document Object Model (DOM) to organize content into different elements.</li>
                    <li>Tags: HTML uses tags to mark up and define different parts of a web page. Tags are written within angle brackets (< and >). For example, the opening tag and closing tag  are used to define a paragraph.</li>
                    <li>Nesting: HTML elements can be nested within one another to create a hierarchical structure. This allows for the organization and grouping of content.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="html">
                <header>HTML</header>
                <p>HTML was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the late 1980s. They envisioned HTML as a way to share scientific information and research among scientists.</p>      
                <p> HTML5, the current major version of HTML, was officially released by the W3C in 2014. It introduced numerous new features and APIs, such as semantic elements, multimedia support, canvas for graphics, local storage, and improved accessibility. HTML5 has become the de facto standard for modern web development and is supported across various web browsers and devices.</p>

                <header>Key CSS Points</header>
                <p>Here are some key CSS pointers:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Styling Techniques: CSS offers various techniques to style elements, such as setting background colors and images, changing text colors and fonts, adding borders and shadows, positioning elements, creating animations and transitions, and more.</li>

                <code>main { background: linear-gradient(to right, skyblue, white) } </code>

                <li>Responsive Design: CSS enables the creation of responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries and flexible layout techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to build responsive and mobile-friendly websites.</li>

                <code>@media (max-width: 600px) { body { font-size: 14px; } .container { padding: 10px; } }</code>

                <li>Browser Compatibility: Different web browsers may render CSS styles differently. It's important to consider cross-browser compatibility and test your CSS code in multiple browsers to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="css">
                <header>CSS</header>
                <p>CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994, while working at CERN with Tim Berners-Lee. Lie recognized the need for a separate styling language to complement HTML, allowing for better separation of content and presentation.</p>

                <code>.container { width: 65%; padding: 10px; margin: 0 auto; }</code>

                <p>CSS has transformed web design by allowing developers to separate content from presentation, making it easier to maintain consistent styles across web pages and create visually appealing websites. Its evolution has contributed to the flexibility, responsiveness, and aesthetics of modern web design.</p>

                <code>main { background-color: black; }</code>

            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="hello_world"> 
                <header>Hello World</header>             
                <p>"Hello, world!" is a common phrase used in programming to introduce beginners to a new programming language or framework. It is often the first program or code snippet people write when learning a new language.</p>
                <p>The "Hello, world!" program serves as a simple starting point to ensure that the basic setup and syntax of a programming language are working correctly. It helps beginners understand the fundamental concepts of displaying output and serves as a building block for more complex programs.</p>

                <code>>>>print=("Hello World")</code>
